0.0.1.3 Release Notes

Primary Goal:  Add User Login and Management Functionality:

	- Thie main purpose of the third alpha release was to create the functionality for users, allowing them to
		- log in
		- log out
		- manage their account info
		- recover their password
		- Site engineers to manage users account info

	- Weâ€™ve reserved 10 levels of user accounts.  I expect the levels to be broken down into the 
	following groups:

			1 - public front-end
			5 - Private front-end
			7 - Site administrators
			10 - Site engineers

	
Questions: 	
	
		- Will the account levels be enough, and is this a good way to organize them?

Table: app_user_users
			id
			name
			email
			username
			password
			bio
			accessLevel
			recoveryToken
